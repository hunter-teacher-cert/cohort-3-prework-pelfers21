public static void zoop() {
    baffle();
    System.out.print("You wugga ");
    baffle();

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print("No, I ");
    zoop();
    System.out.print("I ");
    baffle();
}

Exercise 1  
The point of this exercise is to practice reading code and to make sure that you understand the flow of execution through a program with multiple methods.

a. What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.
No, I wug. (First Line)
You wugga wug. (Second Line)
I wug. (Third Line)
Hint: Start by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.
baffle invokes ("wug" to be printed) and ping ("." prints periods when called)
b. c. Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.

   Stack Diagram
  Ping()
  Baffle()
  Zoop()
  Main()

What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method- It keeps printing "wug." for several lines and then throws an error message "Exception in thread main.java.langStackOverflowError at java.base/java.io.FileOutStream.write(FileOutputStream.java:354)....with a few more lines of error messages then continually prints every other line: at Answer.ping(Answer.java:22) then at Answer.baffle(Answer.java:18) etc
